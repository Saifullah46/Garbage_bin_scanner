Garbagebin Scanner

This apllication is to supervise whether the garbagebin is collected or not . And send the information whether the garbage bin is collected or not to the respective officials . the prototype we've developed is a desktop application written on python. Since this is a desktop apllication, to use this application in realtime the ramchip can be used to run the apllication continously and to send the detected image to the data server to process the information and circulate the report. The xml file used for this application and data set of the application is also attached. The bin is detcted by adding the xml file in the code and saves the detected images in the seperate directory. The environment used to develop this apllication is "Pycharm". The framework used, "Cascade trainer GUI". Opencv, tkinter, osmodule are  the tools used for this application.

HOW TO RUN THE CODE:

step-1:
   declacre the function
   
step-2:
   give xml files in the code
   
step-3:
   import the functions from file
   
step-4:
   run the program
   
step-5:
   Dialog box will appear with "start" button  

step-6:
   press start to detect the object
   
step-7:
   press 'q' to end the code
   
step-8:
   detected images will be saved in the directory
